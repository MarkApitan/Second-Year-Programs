# Data Structure and Algorithm Lab Activity 3: List Comprehension
### Programmed by: Mark Justine L. Apitan, BSCPE 2-3

## Lab exercise 1

from a given list of integers, create a new list using comprehension that will compute the square of odd integer elements.

sample calls
[2,4,3] == [9]
[0,0,1,1] == [1,1]

### Sample run of the program

## Lab exercise 2

Using comprehension,create a new list of tuples from two given lists:

Sample calls
list1[1,2,3]
list2["mark","alice","john]

result: listOfTuple[(1,"mark"),(2,"alice"),(3,"john")] 
### Sample run of the program

## Lab exercise 3
Provide a list comprehension that implementation for a function called vowelsToUpper with the following signature:

method name : vowelsToUpper
input argument : String 
return argument : String

vowelsToUpper must return a version of its String argument with all its vowels changed to their uppercase forms. Nonvowel characters stay as is.

Sample Calls
vowelsToUpper "" == ""
vowelsToUpper "Hello, world!" == "HEllO, wOrld!"
vowelsToUpper "hello hi bye" == "hEllO hI byE"

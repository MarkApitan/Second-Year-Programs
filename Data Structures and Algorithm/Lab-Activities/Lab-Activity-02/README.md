# Data Structure and Algorithm Lab Activity 2: Loop Statements 
### Programmed by: Mark Justine L. Apitan, BSCPE 2-3

## Lab 2 Exercise 1
A teacher named Mrs. Rivera who loved making math fun for her students. One day, a student named Mia asked how to calculate powers, like (2^7). Mrs. Rivera explained, “Imagine you need to multiply 2 by itself seven times. We can solve this using a python code utilizing  special method called recursion to solve this,” 
Can you help the class of Mrs. Rivera by providing the recursive method to calculate powers?
